# Timekeeper
## Requirements
A [userscript][userscript] browser extension like [Tampermonkey][tamper] or [Violentmonkey][violent]

## Install
[Click to install Timekeeper][install]

## Known issues
We're unable to call the functions needed to determine if a stream is live in Greasemonkey, so some functionality is unavailable:
* Clicking the current playback time does nothing
* Seek bar timestamp indicators are drawn (inaccurately) during live streams
